# Quantium Data Analytics Simulation

This repository contains the work completed for the Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage. The objective of the simulation is to apply data analytics to generate actionable insights for commercial decision-making. The project is divided into two main tasks: Task 1 focuses on Chip Client Analysis, and Task 2 involves Control Store Selection and Trial Assessment.

## Task 1: Chip Client Analysis
### Project Overview
The goal of Task 1 is to analyze customer purchase behavior for a chip brand using transactional data. The objective is to derive actionable insights into customer segments, purchasing patterns, and pricing behavior.

### Project Goals
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key insights using graphs and charts
- Perform statistical tests for hypothesis validation
- Provide data-driven recommendations

### Dataset
- **QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv:** Contains customer-level purchase behavior data.
- **QVI_transaction_data.xlsx:** Includes detailed transactional data with product details and sales information.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy

### Key Findings
- Sales peaked around Christmas, with a noticeable drop on Christmas day.
- Mainstream young singles and retirees contributed the most to sales.
- Premium customers generally purchased chips at higher prices.
- Budget older families exhibited a high purchase frequency.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the business could focus marketing campaigns on younger and mid-age singles and couples. Adjusting promotions during festive seasons and targeting premium customer segments may further enhance revenue.

## Task 2: Control Store Selection and Trial Assessment
### Project Objectives
- Identify suitable control stores that match the trial stores.
- Evaluate the performance of trial stores by analyzing key metrics.
- Provide data-driven recommendations based on insights.

### Key Tasks Completed
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
    - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
    - Standardized data for analysis.
2. **Control Store Selection**
    - Applied appropriate metrics to find comparable control stores.
    - Used visualizations to validate similarity.
3. **Trial Assessment**
    - Analyzed performance data to assess the impact of the trial.
    - Visualized sales trends and customer behavior.
4. **Recommendations**
    - Provided actionable insights for business decision-making.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical Analysis

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of both the chip client behavior and the trial store's performance, offering actionable insights for Quantium's commercial decision-making.
